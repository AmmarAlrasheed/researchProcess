# Plan your argument

## Balance your claim and body of evidence

If you have searched thoroughly and skillfully and you have been very lucky, you have a representative, authoritative body of evidence, sufficient to convince your audience of your claim.

Let's assume you searched thoroughly and skillfully, but are not so lucky. Since you cannot change the facts in your body of evidence, you need to reconsider your claim. Hopefully, you can modify it in some small way; this is an easy course correction. Alternatively, your information sources may have revealed a need to overhaul or even reverse your claim. This is a bit riskier, but it can be managed if you work hard and smart.

Be careful: the larger the modification to your claim, the closer you move to starting all over. Generally, you will not have time for this. Consult with your instructor if appropriate.

When there is a good balance or fit between your claim and your evidence, you are ready to proceed.

## Use appropriate template(s) to outline your argument

At the bottom of this file, create an outline of your research argument. Your outline can be based on an appropriate combination of the templates shown below.

At a *minimum*, you should have your main claim with multiple reasons and multiple pieces of evidence for each reason.

### Basic outline

Here is a template for the most basic outline, which applies to all research arguments.
```
Main claim:
    Reason 1:
        Evidence 1:
        Evidence n:
    Reason n:
        Evidence 1:
        Evidence n:
```

Here is an example of completing the basic template, using an example adapted from *The Craft of Research*.
```
Main claim: American higher education should review its "hands-off" policy toward off-campus drinking.
    Reason 1: Dangerous binge drinking has become common
        Evidence 1: Deaths or injuries related to binge drinking increased 19% from 2001-2006
        Evidence 2: Students report a 35% increase in alcohol consumed per drinking session
    Reason 2: Society is holding colleges responsible for off-campus drinking
        Evidence 1: Relevant lawsuits increased by 65% from 2000 to 2010
        Evidence 2: All major insurance carriers require college policies to address off-campus drinking
```

### Including subclaims

To build a convincing argument, you may need to make additional claims besides the main one ("subclaims"). 

For example, if your main claim suggests a solution to a practical problem, you might have subclaims about

- an explanation of the problem's cause,
- a proposal for fixing it,
- the feasibility of the proposed fix,
- why the fix is not worse than the problem, and
- why alternative fixes are not as good. 

With subclaims, the basic outline can be expanded as follows.

```
Main claim:
    Subclaim 1: 
        Reason 1:
            Evidence 1:
            Evidence n:
        Reason n:
            Evidence 1:
            Evidence n:
    Subclaim n: 
        Reason 1:
            Evidence 1:
            Evidence n:
        Reason n:
            Evidence 1:
            Evidence n:
```

### Including subreasons

Recall that a reason is a statement that the researcher thinks up to persuade the audience. Reasons may have subreasons. If necessary, expand the outline as described for subclaims. Here is an example adapted from *The Craft of Research*.
```
Main claim: Emotions play a larger role in rationality than many think.
    Reason 1: Without the emotional centers of the brain, we could not make rational decisions.
        Subreason 1: Persons with damage to emotional centers cannot make the simplest decisions.
            Evidence 1: Case study of Mr. Y.

            ...
```

## Reorganize as needed

Read through your reasons in the order you have listed them. Does the sequence make sense? If a different ordering of reasons would improve the argument, reorganize your outline.
