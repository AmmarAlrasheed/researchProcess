# Gather evidence

The claim of your research motivates all the presentations, reports, or other products that you use to communicate your findings. 

Because a claim may or may not be true, it needs to be supported by an **argument** made up of reasons. A **reason** is a statement that a researcher thinks up, in order to persuade the audience to accept a claim.

But an audience of critical thinkers will reply, 

> "That might be persuasive, if it is true. Why should we believe it is true? What hard facts can you offer?". 

The audience is asking for evidence to support your persuasive reasoning. A strong piece of **evidence** is a shared, public fact that is documented by appropriate sources of information. These information **sources** might be books, journal papers, Web sites, personal interviews, code listings, original proofs, experimental data, etc.

## Record sources and evidence

To find authoritative sources, start by searching the [ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/advsearch.cfm) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com). If you find ACM search hits that you cannot access, your instructor can provide the material to you.

Wikipedia and other tertiary (reference) works are great places to find sources to cite, but they are not themselves appropriate to cite here. Try to find a mix of [primary and secondary sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources).

At the bottom of this file, replace the example placeholders with a top-level heading for each information source (book, article, etc.) containing evidence you might use in your argument.

Under the heading, put: 

1. Basic bibliography information. This makes lets you easily create a list of cited works later.
2. Individual pieces of evidence. Using bullet lists or other appropriate formats, record the shared public facts that you will use. For each:
   1. Include page numbers or similar "location" information for your future use.
   2. Protect yourself from unintentional plagiarism. Use quotation marks if you are taking words directly from the source. Otherwise, make sure the record is in your own words.

## Evaluate your evidence

At some point, you will begin to feel that you have gathered enough evidence to move forward, or that you have gathered all the evidence that you can.

Evaluate your entire collection of evidence. Then answer the following questions. (Be honest. If your evidence is weak, that will be addressed in the next step of the process.)

Is there enough evidence to support your claim? (One quotation or data point will not satisfy your audience.)
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

Is the evidence representative? (Your audience will be suspicious if you address a small portion of the relevant data, or if your evidence is based on unusual cases.)
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
