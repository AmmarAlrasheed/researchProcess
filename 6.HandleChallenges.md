# Handle challenges

## Anticipating challenges

No matter how strong your research argument is, it will be challenged by a skeptical audience. This skepticism is not belligerent; it helps academic fields to move in appropriate directions.

You strengthen your argument further when you anticipate likely challenges, acknowledge them, and respond to them. If you fail to do this, your audience will conclude that you are too foolish to identify the likely challenges, or too dishonest to admit they exist.

You should anticipate challenges that target your *claims*, as in the following examples.

- I don't think your solution actually fits with your problem.
- I think you overstate things. I can think of situations where your claim does not apply.
- I think that your claim is expensive/dangerous/controversial/impractical ...

You should anticipate challenges that target your *reasons*, as in the following examples.

- I want to see hard numbers that back this up, not just anecdotes.
- I want to see specific examples of real cases, not just numbers.
- I think your evidence is inaccurate or doesn't add up.
- I think you are hiding in vague words. What does "many" mean?
- I think your information is out of date.
- I think your evidence is not representative. You didn't get evidence on all the categories.
- I think your sources are not authoritative. Why should I trust them?
- I think you have too little evidence.

You should anticipate challenges that target the *relationship between a claim and a reason*.

- Your reason may be right, but I don't agree that it supports your claim. Why is it relevant?

In the space at the bottom of this file, use the guidance above to list the challenges you anticipate that your audience might make to your research argument.
    
## Responding to challenges

### Challenges that attack claims, or reasons

*The Craft of Research* suggests that you address each of these challenges with a two-part sentence (or sometimes two consecutive sentences). The first part acknowledges the challenge, and the second part responds to it. The two parts are often connected with an expression of disagreement such as *however, but, nevertheless, nonetheless, on the other hand*.

Here are some possibilities for the introductory acknowledgement. (These are listed from most to least dismissive in tone.)

- Downplay the challenge with words like *despite, regardless, notwithstanding, although, while, even though*. Example: **Although** there are economic problems in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia remains a strong ...
- Introduce statements that challenge your argument using *seem, appear, may, could, plausibly, justifiably, reasonably*, etc. Example: The proposal **may** have some merit, **but** ...
- Introduce alternative viewpoints by attributing them to unnamed sources. Example: **Some evidence suggests** television viewing is related to violence, **however** ...
- Use your own voice. Example: **It is true that** no good evidence proves that coffee causes cancer. **Nevertheless** ...

The second part of the sentence could be one of the following. (These are listed from least to most aggressive in tone.)

- Admit to some limitations. Example: ... but it is difficult to follow this argument.
- Point out unsettled issues. Example: ... however there are other issues to consider.
- Be blunt. Example: ... but this argument is irrelevant.

For each challenge to a claim or reason that you listed below, write a brief acknowledgement and response. In most cases, this will be a two-part sentence as described above. (Of course the sentences are only a beginning. In a full research report, you would need to support your statement that a challenge is irrelevant. You can treat this as a subordinate argument, and apply as much of this research process, in miniature, as you need.)

### Challenges that attack the relationship between a claim and a reason

Respond to this type of challenge with a subordinate argument that connects the reason to the claim. This type of subordinate argument is called a **warrant**. It explains the principles behind your reasoning, to support the idea that the reason really is relevant to the claim. 

Consider this example from *The Craft of Research*. 
- Claim: Russia faces a falling standard of living. 
- Reason: Russia's birthrate is only 1.17 and men's life expectancy has dropped to 58.
- Anticipated challenge: Those numbers are accurate, but they have no connection to standard of living.
- Warrant: In general, a shrinking labor pool means a country's economic future is grim. In this particular case, low birth rate and earlier deaths mean a smaller labor force, and the resulting weak economy will lower the standard of living.

The warrant explains the connection between the reason and claim. Warrants often proceed from a general rule or principle to a specific application of the rule.

If you listed challenges to the connection between a claim and a reason, outline a warrant for each, supporting your reason's relevance to your claim.
