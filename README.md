# A Research Process

This repository contains instructions that guide you through a research process adapted from *The Craft of Research* by Booth, Colomb, and Williams.

Major milestones in this process are:
- [ ] Stating a precise, significant claim
- [ ] Planning a convincing, evidence-based argument for your claim
- [ ] Communicating your argument to appropriate audiences, in the form(s) of a report, presentation, poster, etc.

This repository is designed to support simultaneous exploration of multiple possible research topics, in parallel. A `git` branch named `firstIdea` has been designated the repo's default branch; use it to explore your first idea. Other ideas can be tracked by creating additional working branches. The `master` branch is protected, because it will be reserved for official assignment submission, not exploration or  "work in progress". You will need to use the pull request process to select and move content from a working branch to the `master` branch. If this is new to you, consult your instructor for assistance.
