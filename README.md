# A Research Process

This repository contains instructions that guide you through a research process adapted from *The Craft of Research* by Booth, Colomb, and Williams.

Major milestones in this process are:
- [ ] Stating a precise, significant claim
- [ ] Planning a convincing, evidence-based argument for your claim
- [ ] Communicating your argument to appropriate audiences, in the form(s) of a report, presentation, poster, etc.
