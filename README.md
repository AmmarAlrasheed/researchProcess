# A Research Process

This repository contains instructions that guide you through a research process adapted from *The Craft of Research* by Booth, Colomb, and Williams.

Major milestones in this process are:
- [ ] Stating a precise, significant claim
- [ ] Planning a convincing, evidence-based argument for your claim
- [ ] Communicating your argument to appropriate audiences, in the form(s) of a report, presentation, poster, etc.

This repository is designed to support simultaneous exploration of multiple possible research topics, in parallel. A `git` branch named `firstIdea` has been created for you; use it to explore your first idea. Other ideas can be tracked by creating additional working branches. Use the `master` branch only for official assignment submission, not exploration or  "work in progress". You should use the pull request process to select and move content from a working branch to the `master` branch. If this is new to you, consult your instructor for assistance.

## For GitHub experts

You have administrative access to your repo. You can use the `Settings` to protect your `master` branch so that it cannot be changed by direct commit, but only by pull requests. You can also choose a different default branch if that is convenient.
